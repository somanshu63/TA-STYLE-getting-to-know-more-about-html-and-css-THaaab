                <h1>cat</h1>
                <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.<br>
                    It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.<br>
                     A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.<br>
                     Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. <br>
                     About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries<br>
                    The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. <br>
                    Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. <br>Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.<br>
                     A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species.<br>
                      It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.<br>
                      Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.[</p>

                <h1>dog</h1>
                <p>The dog or domestic dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail. <br> 
                    The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8]<br>
                    The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[9][8] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7] before the development of agriculture.
                    Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.<br>
                    Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.<br>
                    The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.<br>
                     Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people.<br>
                      This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".</p>
