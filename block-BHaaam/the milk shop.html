        <p>A grocery store (North America), grocery[1] or grocery shop (UK), is a store that primarily retails a general range of food products,[2] which may be fresh or packaged.<br> In everyday U.S. usage, however, "grocery store" is a synonym for supermarket,[3] and is not used to refer to other types of stores that sell groceries. <br>In the UK, shops that sell food are distinguished as grocers[3] or grocery shops, though in everyday use, people usually use either the term "supermarket" or, for a smaller type of store that sells groceries, a "corner shop"[4] or "convenience shop".
            Larger types of stores that sell groceries, such as supermarkets and hypermarkets, usually stock significant amounts of non-food products, such as clothing and household items.<br> Small grocery stores that sell mainly fruit and vegetables are known as greengrocers (Britain) or produce markets (U.S.), and small grocery stores that predominantly sell prepared food, such as candy and snacks, are known as convenience shops or delicatessens. </p>
